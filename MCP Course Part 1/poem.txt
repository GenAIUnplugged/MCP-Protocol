The Unexpected Sneeze

I felt a tickle in my nose,
While giving quite important prose.
My speech was reaching crescendo,
When suddenly I had to blow!

"AH-CHOO!" it echoed through the hall,
My papers scattered, watch them fall.
My glasses flew, my tie askew,
The audience? They laughed on cue.

The mayor blinked, the press corps grinned,
My dignity? Completely thinned.
But with a bow and sheepish smile,
I proved that sneezes have their style.

So if you're called to speak aloud,
Before a most important crowd,
Remember when your nose feels weird,
Prepare to be remembered, feared.

For nothing brings more instant fame,
Than when your sinuses exclaim.
The greatest speeches fade with time,
But epic sneezes? They're sublime.
